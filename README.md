Analyzed workforce diversity metrics to provide insights into hiring trends, promotions, turnover, and employee demographics.


### Tools & Skills Used:
* Power BI (DAX, Data Modeling, Slicers, Filters, Drilldowns)
* Excel (Data Preparation)
* Data Cleaning & Transformation

### Key Highlights:

### Hiring Insights:
* Visualized year-wise hiring trends from 2011 to 2020.
* Analyzed gender-wise hiring distribution across job positions (e.g., Junior Officer to Director).
* Highlighted new hires in FY20 showing near gender balance (Male: 51.52%, Female: 48.48%).

### Promotion & Performance:
* Compared FY20 vs FY21 promotions by gender and department.
* Created job level-wise promotion analysis to identify potential gender disparities (e.g., only 13% of Manager promotions were female).
* Tracked average performance ratings across genders (Female: 2.41 vs Male: 2.36).

### Turnover Analysis:
* Built donut charts and breakdowns by position showing 13.2% turnover rate.
* Detailed FY20 leavers by job roles, helping identify high-risk areas (e.g., Junior Officer had the highest exits).

### Impact:
Enabled HR and leadership teams to make data-driven decisions to promote inclusivity, reduce turnover, and address gender imbalances in leadership roles.
